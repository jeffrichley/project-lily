# Create Specification for Project Lily

## Overview
This document provides instructions for creating new feature specifications for Project Lily. Specifications should be created for any new feature, enhancement, or significant change to the codebase.

## Specification Structure

### 1. Specification Header
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Specification

**Status**: [Draft | In Review | Approved | Implemented]
**Created**: [Date] (make sure to use the correct current date)
**Author**: [Name]
**Priority**: [High | Medium | Low]
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]
```

### 2. Problem Statement
- Clearly describe the problem or need being addressed
- Include user stories or use cases
- Explain why this feature is important
- Reference related issues or discussions

### 3. Goals and Success Criteria
- List specific, measurable goals
- Define acceptance criteria
- Include performance requirements if applicable
- Specify quality gates

### 4. Technical Design
- Architecture overview
- Data models and interfaces
- API design if applicable
- Database schema changes if needed
- Security considerations

### 5. Implementation Plan
- Break down into smaller tasks
- Identify dependencies
- Estimate effort for each task
- Define milestones and deliverables

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit test requirements
- Integration test requirements
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Performance testing if needed

### 7. Documentation Requirements
- User documentation updates
- API documentation
- Code comments and docstrings
- Migration guides if needed

### 8. Risks and Mitigation
- Identify potential risks
- Propose mitigation strategies
- Consider backward compatibility
- Plan for rollback if needed

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Technical design reviewed
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Documentation plan created
- [ ] Backward compatibility considered
- [ ] Rollback plan defined
```

## Review Process

### 1. Draft Review
- Author creates initial specification
- Technical team reviews for feasibility
- Security team reviews for implications
- Product team reviews for alignment

### 2. Implementation Review
- Break down into implementation tasks
- Assign responsibilities
- Set timelines and milestones
- Define quality gates

### 3. Final Review
- Review implementation against specification
- Verify all acceptance criteria met
- Ensure documentation is complete
- Plan for deployment

## Specification Location

All specifications should be stored in:
```
.agent-os/specs/
├── [feature-name].md
├── [feature-name].md
└── [feature-name].md
```

## Approval Process

1. **Draft**: Initial specification created
2. **In Review**: Under technical and product review
3. **Approved**: Ready for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Feature completed and deployed

## Best Practices

- Keep specifications focused and concise
- Include concrete examples and use cases
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Plan for testing from the beginning
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Consider impact on existing features
- Plan for monitoring and observability
