# Project Lily Best Practices

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for new development
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Squash commits before merging
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use conventional commit format

### Code Review
- Review all code changes before merging
- Focus on functionality, security, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback
- Ensure tests are included with new features
- Verify documentation is updated

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD preferred)
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Maintain high test coverage
- Run full test suite before merging

## Architecture Best Practices

### Separation of Concerns
- Keep business logic separate from UI code
- Use dependency injection for external services
- Implement clear interfaces between modules
- Avoid tight coupling between components

### Error Handling
- Use specific exception types
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Implement graceful degradation
- Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### Configuration Management
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Validate configuration on startup
- Provide sensible defaults
- Use type-safe configuration objects
- Document all configuration options

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file paths and commands
- Use allowlists for allowed operations
- Implement proper access controls
- Log security-relevant events

### Secret Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement secure configuration storage
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least privilege principle

### Code Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use security scanning tools
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all external inputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Performance Best Practices

### Code Optimization
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize memory allocations
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Startup Performance
- Lazy load heavy dependencies
- Minimize import time
- Use efficient configuration loading
- Cache parsed configurations
- Optimize critical paths

### Memory Management
- Use context managers for resources
- Avoid memory leaks
- Monitor memory usage
- Use generators for large datasets
- Implement proper cleanup

## User Experience Best Practices

### CLI Design
- Provide clear help messages
- Use consistent command structure
- Implement tab completion
- Show progress for long operations
- Provide meaningful error messages

### Error Messages
- Be specific about what went wrong
- Suggest how to fix the problem
- Use consistent error message format
- Provide context when possible
- Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages

### Documentation
- Write clear, concise documentation
- Include usage examples
- Keep documentation up to date
- Use consistent formatting
- Provide troubleshooting guides

## Code Quality Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Avoid code duplication
- Follow DRY principle
- Use appropriate abstractions

### Type Safety
- Use type hints consistently
- Avoid `Any` type when possible
- Use proper generic types
- Validate types at runtime when needed
- Use mypy for static type checking

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use consistent formatting
- Write self-documenting code
- Use appropriate comments
- Keep code readable and maintainable

## Testing Best Practices

### Test Design
- Write tests that are easy to understand
- Use descriptive test names
- Test one thing per test
- Use appropriate assertions
- Keep tests independent

### Test Data
- Use factories for test data
- Avoid hardcoded test values
- Use realistic test scenarios
- Clean up test data properly
- Use appropriate test fixtures

### Test Maintenance
- Keep tests up to date with code changes
- Refactor tests when needed
- Remove obsolete tests
- Monitor test performance
- Use test coverage as a guide, not a goal

## Deployment Best Practices

### Package Management
- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain changelog
- Test package installation
- Provide clear installation instructions
- Use appropriate package metadata

### Distribution
- Use CI/CD for automated releases
- Test on multiple platforms
- Provide multiple installation methods
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Monitor package downloads and issues

### Monitoring
- Implement proper logging
- Monitor application performance
- Track error rates
- Collect user feedback
- Use analytics appropriately

## Community Best Practices

### Open Source
- Be welcoming to contributors
- Provide clear contribution guidelines
- Respond to issues promptly
- Maintain good documentation
- Follow open source best practices

### Communication
- Be respectful and professional
- Provide constructive feedback
- Listen to user feedback
- Be transparent about decisions
- Maintain good relationships with contributors

### Maintenance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Address security vulnerabilities promptly
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Provide migration guides
- Support multiple Python versions
