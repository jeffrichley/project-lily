# Project Lily Mission

## Vision
Project Lily is an intelligent, persistent development assistant that transforms the command line into an interactive AI-powered workspace. It combines the convenience of a traditional CLI with the intelligence and context-awareness of modern AI agents.

## Mission Statement
To create a lightweight, persistent AI agent that lives in your terminal, providing continuous assistance for development tasks through interactive conversations, automated command execution, and extensible slash commands.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Persistent Intelligence**: Unlike traditional CLI tools that require restarting for each task, Lily maintains context and conversation history throughout your development session
- **Interactive Development**: Combines the power of AI conversation with direct command execution and file manipulation
- **Extensible Commands**: User-defined slash commands via `.petal` files enable custom workflows and automation
- **Lightweight Agent Shell**: Minimal overhead with maximum functionality, designed to feel like a natural extension of your development environment

## Target Users
- **Developers** who want AI assistance without leaving their terminal
- **DevOps Engineers** who need to automate complex workflows
- **System Administrators** who require intelligent command execution
- **Anyone** who wants to enhance their command line productivity with AI

## Success Metrics
- Reduced time to complete development tasks
- Increased adoption of AI-assisted development workflows
- Positive developer experience feedback
- Growing ecosystem of `.petal` command files
